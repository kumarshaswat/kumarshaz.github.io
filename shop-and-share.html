							<p>I enjoy working in a team because I believe that it brings out the best in people. When we work together, we are able to share ideas, support each other, and learn from one another. This allows us to create something that is greater than what any one person could achieve on their own.</p>
							<p>When I applied to ACM UTD Projects, I was not very confident about getting selected because I have always heard from my friends that it is quite difficult to get in and only a select amount of people make it. However, when I opened my email and read that I was selected to participate, I was very elated and fulfilled. That is when I realized that I had been chosen for my expertise and ability to contribute to the success of a project. This recognition was extremely gratifying and motivating. I was assigned the project "Shop&Share", which was actually my 1st pick out of 3 other projects!</p>
							<p>Shop&Share is an innovative app that allows users to create and share shopping lists with their families and roommates in real-time. With Shop&Share, users can easily add items to their shopping list, which will automatically be updated and shared with everyone else on the list. This means that everyone can see what has been added and what still needs to be purchased, making it easy to plan and coordinate grocery shopping trips.</p>
							<p>Working with a team of five people on an app was both challenging and rewarding. I would like to thank my amazing teammates Aryan Kapoor, Krish Chanda, Vy Nguyen, Soumika Seelam, our project manager Palak Bhargava, and our industry mentor Xavier Richardson. Each person brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table, which can help create a well-rounded and polished final product. However, we had to coordinate our schedules, divide tasks, and communicate effectively to ensure that the app was completed on time and to the best of our abilities. One of the biggest challenges we faced was managing the different personalities and work styles within the team. We had to find a way to work together and support each other, despite our differences. To keep everyone on task, we held regular meetings to discuss progress, share ideas, and resolve any issues that arose. We also made sure to celebrate our achievements along the way, which helped to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere.</p>
							<p>Presenting the app to the judges was a nerve-wracking experience, but we were confident in our work and were able to answer their questions and address any concerns they had. In the end, our hard work paid off. The app was completed on time and was well-received by the judges. We were proud of the final product and were grateful for the opportunity to work together on this project.</p>
							<p>Overall, working on a project with a team was a valuable learning experience. We learned how to communicate, collaborate, and problem-solve as a team, and most importantly, we were able to create an app that we were proud of.</p>
